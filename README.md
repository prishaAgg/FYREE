# Clinic Simlulation
This is a Discrete Event Simulation Model for a rapid clinic.
When there is more than one provider, we also need to consider how to assign patients to providers. 
We want to have patients always go to the provider with the shortest line.
Since I don't have the permission to share the data, I cannot publish it in this repo. 
I can provide first five entries (with alias patient MRNs) in the data file in this repo.
